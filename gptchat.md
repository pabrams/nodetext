## Code a basic framework for a menu-driven text-based game, in node

Sure! Here’s a basic framework for a menu-driven, text-based game in Node.js. It uses simple input/output via the terminal and provides a menu for the player to choose actions.
Node.js Text-based Game Framework

    Install the readline module for handling user input in the terminal (no need to install it if you're using recent Node.js versions since it’s built-in).

    Create a file, say game.js, and use the following code: 
    (see game.js in appropriate commit)

How the Game Works:

    When the game starts, it displays a main menu with three options: Start Game, View Inventory, or Exit.
    The player can start the game, where they enter their character’s name and encounter an enemy.
    They have the option to fight or run. If they fight, damage is randomly dealt to them, and their health decreases.
    After winning the fight, the player earns loot that gets added to their inventory.
    The player can also view their inventory from the main menu.
    The game ends if the player’s health drops to zero or if they choose to exit.

You can modify this framework to add more features, like leveling up, more encounters, or different types of enemies!

## Modify the code in your previous answer to accept input without hitting enter

To modify the game to accept input without hitting enter (making it more interactive), we need to listen for individual keypresses rather than waiting for the user to press "Enter". This can be done using the readline module in Node.js, but with a slightly different approach that uses the keypress event.

Here’s the modified version of the code:
Modified Node.js Text-based Game with Real-time Input

Changes made:

    Real-time input with keypress events: I replaced the rl.question method with process.stdin.once('keypress') to capture keypresses without waiting for "Enter".
    Clearing the console: After each menu or event, the console is cleared (console.clear()) to make it feel more like a game loop.
    Using process.stdin.setRawMode(true): This allows the program to capture individual keypresses without waiting for the Enter key.
